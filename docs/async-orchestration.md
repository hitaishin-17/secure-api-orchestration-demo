Async Orchestration in Secure API Orchestration Demo

This document outlines how asynchronous orchestration can be introduced in the Secure API Orchestration Demo to improve performance, scalability, and user experience — especially in multi-service, event-driven scenarios.

What is Async Orchestration?

Asynchronous orchestration is a pattern where the main orchestration flow triggers tasks that run independently, allowing the system to:
	•	Avoid blocking calls
	•	Handle high throughput
	•	React to events or messages

⸻

Benefits of Async Orchestration
	•	🚀 Non-blocking execution
	•	⚡ Faster response times
	•	🔁 Retry/failure handling possible via queues
	•	🔄 Event-driven processing between microservices
	•	📦 Better user experience with background operations

🔄 Implementation Strategy

We can implement async orchestration using:

1. Spring Events (Simple In-App Async)
   ```
   @Component
public class CustomerEventPublisher {
    @Autowired private ApplicationEventPublisher publisher;

    public void publish(Customer customer) {
        publisher.publishEvent(new CustomerCreatedEvent(this, customer));
    }
}

public class CustomerCreatedEvent extends ApplicationEvent {
    private final Customer customer;
    public CustomerCreatedEvent(Object source, Customer customer) {
        super(source);
        this.customer = customer;
    }
    public Customer getCustomer() { return customer; }
}

@Async
@EventListener
public void handleCustomerCreated(CustomerCreatedEvent event) {
    // e.g., Send welcome email, notify analytics, etc.
}
```
2. Message Queue with Kafka (Distributed Async)

You can produce customer creation events to a Kafka topic and consume them asynchronously via a separate microservice or background job.
	•	Topic: customer.created
	•	Producer: sends event post-creation
	•	Consumer: triggers downstream logic (e.g., notify CRM, log audit)

⸻

🔁 BPMN + Async Tasks (Advanced Option)

With tools like Camunda or Flowable, you can define orchestration flows with async task markers (asyncBefore, asyncAfter) and error handling.

Best for:
	•	Long-running transactions
	•	Retry and compensation logic
	•	Visual process modeling

⸻

🧪 Sample Use Case
POST /api/customers

Triggers:
	1.	Save to MongoDB (sync)
	2.	Publish event to Kafka or internal Spring Event (async)
	3.	Downstream services react:
	•	CRM updated
	•	Welcome email sent
	•	Audit log stored

⸻

🔒 Security Considerations
	•	Sign or validate events to prevent tampering
	•	Use JWT or API keys for internal service auth
	•	Apply rate limiting to event consumers

⸻

🧰 Tools & Libraries
| **Purpose**        | **Tool**              |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Event handling     | Spring Events         |
| Messaging          | Kafka, RabbitMQ       |
| Workflow engine    | Camunda, Flowable     |
| Async support      | `@Async`, `Executor`  |

Final Thoughts

Even in a simple CRUD API, async orchestration improves:
	•	Separation of concerns
	•	System resilience
	•	Future scalability

Start with internal Spring events → move to message queues → scale into BPMN if needed.
